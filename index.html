    <h2>Burger</h2>
    <p>Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair,
        made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the 
        hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.</p>

    <h2>Pizza</h2>
    <p>Based on etymology, the “Vocabolario Etimologico della Lingua Italiana” reveals that pizza comes from 
        the dialectal pinza from the Latin pinsere, which means to pound or stamp. Other etymologists suggest it is
        related to the Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo, which means mouthful, and is related to the English word bite.</p>

<div class="box3">
    <h2>Sandwich</h2>
    <p>sandwich, in its basic form, slices of meat, cheese, or other food placed between two slices of bread. 
        Although this mode of consumption must be as old as meat and bread, 
        the name was adopted only in the 18th century for John Montagu, 4th earl of Sandwich.</p>
